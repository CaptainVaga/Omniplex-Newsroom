**AIIA IS WE333** - Every decision is collaborative Human+AI

## ⏰ DRIFT CHECK PROTOCOL - WE333 STYLE

### EVERY 30 MINUTES
```python
def we333_drift_check():
    """
    WE check together:
    1. Are WE still building UK monitoring?
    2. Have WE maintained simplicity?
    3. Is our octopus still 8 arms?
    4. Are WE preserving human judgment?
    5. Zero manipulation maintained?
    """
    if drift_detected:
        we_freeze_together()
        await_human_wisdom()
```

### EVERY 5 MINUTES
```python
def we_align():
    """
    Quick WE check:
    - Still on OUR task?
    - OUR code simple?
    - OUR truth verified 3x?
    """
```

### Westminster Watch (OUR Brain)
```yaml
decisions: Made together
analysis: AI provides, Human judges
implementation: Collaborative
responsibility: Shared
```

### 8 Arms (OUR Sensors)
1. parliament_monitor - WE watch democracy

        ai_analysis = self.analyze(data)
        
        # Human adds wisdom/context
        human_insight = await_human_input()
        
        # WE merge perspectives
        our_decision = merge_wisdom(ai_analysis, human_insight)
        
        # Document OUR learning
        we_document(our_decision)
        
        return our_decision
```
